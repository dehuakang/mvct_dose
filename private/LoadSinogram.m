function sinogram = LoadSinogram(path, name)
% LoadSinogram reads in a binary file, verifies it is formatted correctly,
% and returns a 64 x n array containing the sinogram values.  The function
% will attempt to automatically determine the file format; acceptable
% number formats are single or double, while acceptable endian formats big 
% or little.
%
% The following variables are required for proper execution: 
%   path: string containing the path to the sinogram file
%   name: string containing the name of the binary sinogram in path
%
% The following variables are returned upon succesful completion:
%   sinogram: 64 x n array of leaf open fractions. If unsuccessful, an
%       empty array is returned.
